================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

The Privacy Officer Dashboard is the core differentiator feature that allows
administrators to:

   • Manage organizational structure (departments)
   • Invite and manage employees
   • Create and assign policy bundles
   • Track compliance organization-wide
   • Identify non-compliant employees
   • Send reminders for pending attestations

The interface is professional, modern, and intuitive. The dark theme with
gradient accents creates a sophisticated look that stands out from typical
admin dashboards.

All components are type-safe, well-documented, and follow React best practices.

Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND READY FOR PRODUCTION
