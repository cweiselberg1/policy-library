Data Backup and Storage

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In Compliance with 45 C.F.R. § 164.308(a)(7)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

This policy establishes the required procedures to create, maintain, and secure retrievable exact copies of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) in accordance with the HIPAA Security Rule’s Contingency Plan standard and its Data Backup Plan implementation specification.

2  POLICY STATEMENT

[Company] will establish and implement procedures to ensure that exact, retrievable copies of all ePHI are securely backed up and available for restoration in the event of data loss, system failure, disaster, or other emergency.

3  DATA BACKUP REQUIREMENTS

4  DATA DEVICE AUDIT OF EPHI

Maintain an up-to-date audit/catalog of all ‘Internet of Things’ hardware devices and locations where ePHI is stored or processed.

5  BACKUP FREQUENCY

Perform daily backups of all ePHI.

Retain weekly, monthly, and annual backup copies as appropriate for operational and regulatory needs.

Backups must be sufficiently robust and have the ability to fully restore all ePHI in the event of loss or corruption.

6  BACKUP MEDIA AND STORAGE

Maintain at least three copies of ePHI (production, onsite backup, offsite backup).

Store backups on at least two different types of media (e.g., disk, cloud, tape).

At least one backup copy must be stored securely offsite or in a geographically separate location to protect against local disasters.

When the decision is made as to where this off-site backup will exist, please document where that location is ________ HERE _________.

All backup media must be physically secured against unauthorized access, theft, or environmental hazards.

7  DATA ENCRYPTION

All backup data must be encrypted at rest and in transit using a minimum of 256-bit AES encryption.

8  ACCESS TO BACKUP SYSTEMS AND MEDIA MUST REQUIRE TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION.

9  DATA RESTORATION

Backups must be regularly tested by restoring sample data to verify the integrity and retrievability of ePHI.

Document all backup tests and restoration attempts, including date, time, and outcome.

10  BACKUP DOCUMENTATION

Maintain records of all backup activities (One to be kept on-site and one off-site), including:

Date and time of backup.

System and data type.

Storage location.

Responsible personnel.

Document any physical or digital movement of backup media and maintain logs of access to this media.

11  ADMINISTRATIVE SAFEGUARDS

12  ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY

The HIPAA Compliance Officer has overall responsibility for the backup program and will delegate operational duties as appropriate.

Each department must assign personnel responsible for implementing and monitoring backup procedures.

13  ACCESS CONTROLS

14  LIMIT ACCESS TO BACKUP SYSTEMS AND MEDIA TO AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

Business Associate Agreements:

If using third-party backup or offsite storage services, ensure a valid Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is in place to require HIPAA-compliant safeguards.

If using, or planning to use, third-party backup or offsite storage services, [Company]’s prospective B.A. is required to satisfactorily complete a vendor risk analysis before the sharing of PHI begins.

This is done to determine the security posture of the B.A. and ensure they have the proper safeguards in place to protect PHI you are responsible for.

15  TESTING AND REVISION

16  TESTING

Periodically test backup and restoration procedures to ensure data can be accurately and promptly restored as needed.

17  REVIEW AND REVISE BACKUP PROCEDURES BASED ON TEST RESULTS AND OPERATIONAL CHANGES.

18  REVIEW

This policy and all backup procedures will be reviewed at least annually or whenever there is a significant change to systems, processes, or regulations.

19  DATA RETENTION AND DESTRUCTION

20  RETENTION

Retain backup copies of ePHI and related documentation for a minimum of six years, as required by HIPAA.

Follow organizational and regulatory requirements for the retention of risk assessments, disaster recovery plans, and other compliance documentation.

21  DESTRUCTION

When backup media is no longer needed or is being repurposed, ensure data is securely destroyed or sanitized according to organizational policy and NIST 800-88 standards with regards to media sanitization and destruction.

22  EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES

Additional or derivative copies of ePHI do not require backup if the original source is properly backed up and can be restored in a timely manner.

All exceptions must be documented and approved by the HIPAA Compliance Officer, or their qualified designee(s).

23  ENFORCEMENT

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may carry civil or criminal penalties under HIPAA regulations.

24  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually or upon significant changes to facility operations, technology, or applicable regulations.
