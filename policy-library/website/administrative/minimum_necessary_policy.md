Minimum Necessary

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In Compliance with 45 CFR § 164.502(b)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To establish guidelines ensuring the use, disclosure, and requests of Protected Health Information (PHI) are limited to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose, as required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

2  POLICY STATEMENT

[Company] will make reasonable efforts to limit the use, disclosure, and request for PHI to the minimum necessary information needed to achieve the intended purpose.

PHI shall not be used or disclosed in its entirety except when:

Required by law

Requested by or for treatment

Disclosed to the individual who is the subject of the information

Authorized in writing by the individual

3  PROCEDURES

4  ROLE-BASED ACCESS

Access to PHI is granted based on each job role’s needs. Each department must determine the types of PHI necessary for each workforce member to perform their duties and grant access accordingly.

5  WORKFORCE MEMBERS SHOULD ONLY ACCESS THE MINIMUM PHI NECESSARY FOR THEIR ASSIGNED TASKS.

6  USE OF PHI

7  BEFORE USING PHI, VERIFY THAT THE INFORMATION IS NECESSARY FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE.

Avoid discussing or displaying PHI where it can be overheard or seen by unauthorized persons.

8  DISCLOSURES OF PHI

When disclosing PHI, limit the information to what is required for the request.

For routine disclosures, standard protocols will be developed, specifying what PHI is disclosed regularly.

For non-routine disclosures, a case-by-case review must be conducted to determine the minimum necessary information.

9  REQUESTS FOR PHI

Requests for PHI from outside the organization will be reviewed to ensure only the minimum necessary is provided, unless it is for treatment purposes.

Requests for PHI from within the organization must follow the same principle: only the minimum necessary for the internal purpose.

10  TRAINING AND AWARENESS

All workforce members receive initial and annual training regarding the minimum necessary standard and how to apply it.

11  MONITORING AND SANCTIONS

12  ROUTINE MONITORING WILL OCCUR TO DETECT INAPPROPRIATE ACCESS, USE, OR DISCLOSURE OF PHI.

Violations will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination or contract cancellation.

13  EXCEPTIONS

Minimum necessary does not apply to:

Disclosures to or requests by a healthcare provider for treatment

Disclosures to the individual who is the subject of the information

Uses or disclosures made pursuant to a valid authorization

Disclosures required by law

14  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually or upon significant changes to facility operations, technology, or applicable regulations.
