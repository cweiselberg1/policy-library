Personal Representatives

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Reference: 45 CFR §164.502(g)

1  PURPOSE

To ensure [Organization Name] complies with the HIPAA Privacy Rule by appropriately recognizing and responding to personal representatives of individuals, as defined by federal regulation and applicable state law, regarding access to and control over PHI.

2  SCOPE

This policy applies to all workforce members, contractors, and business associates who create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of [Organization Name].

3  DEFINITIONS

Personal Representative: A person authorized under applicable law to act on behalf of an individual in making health care decisions, including access to PHI12.

4  PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI): INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED IN ANY FORM.

5  POLICY STATEMENTS

6  GENERAL RULE

[Organization Name] will treat a personal representative as the individual for all purposes regarding rights and requirements under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, including the right to access and control PHI, unless an exception applies132.

7  IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION

Personal representatives must provide documentation of their authority under applicable law (e.g., health care power of attorney, court order, parental rights, guardianship papers)12.

The identity and authority of the personal representative must be verified before access to PHI is granted1.

8  ADULTS AND EMANCIPATED MINORS

A person with legal authority to act on behalf of an adult or emancipated minor for health care decisions will be treated as the personal representative for purposes of PHI access412.

9  UNEMANCIPATED MINORS

For unemancipated minors, a parent, guardian, or person acting in loco parentis is the personal representative, unless:

The minor may lawfully consent to their own care and has not requested parental involvement.

The minor receives care at the direction of a court or a court-appointed person.

The parent or guardian agrees to a confidential relationship between the provider and the minor.

Disclosure is otherwise restricted by state or federal law412.

10  DECEASED INDIVIDUALS

The executor, administrator, or other person authorized under law to act on behalf of a deceased individual or the individual’s estate will be treated as the personal representative for PHI purposes425.

11  EXCEPTIONS

[Organization Name] may elect not to treat a person as a personal representative if:

There is a reasonable belief that the individual has been or may be subjected to domestic violence, abuse, or neglect by the personal representative, or treating them as such could endanger the individual.

In the exercise of professional judgment, it is determined that it is not in the best interest of the individual to treat the person as the personal representative415.

12  THE SCOPE OF ACCESS FOR A PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE IS LIMITED TO PHI RELEVANT TO THEIR AUTHORITY2.

13  DENIAL OF ACCESS

14  ACCESS BY A PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE MAY BE DENIED IF

The PHI is outside the designated record set.

The PHI consists of psychotherapy notes or was obtained under a promise of confidentiality.

15  THE PROVIDER DETERMINES THAT ACCESS IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO ENDANGER THE INDIVIDUAL OR OTHERS4.

16  STATE LAW

This policy will be implemented in accordance with applicable state laws regarding personal representatives, minors, and health care decision-making authority412.

17  DOCUMENTATION

All determinations regarding personal representatives, including any exceptions or denials of access, must be documented in the individual’s record.

Copies of legal documents establishing personal representative status must be retained as part of the designated record set12.

18  TRAINING

All workforce members with responsibilities for PHI access or disclosure will receive training on this policy and the requirements of 45 CFR §164.502(g).

19  REVIEW

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in law, regulation, or organizational practices.

This policy ensures that your organization meets HIPAA’s requirements for recognizing and managing personal representatives, including necessary exceptions and documentation, as required by 45 CFR §164.502(g)4125.
