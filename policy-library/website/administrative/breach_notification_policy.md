45 CFR §§ 164.400–414

1  IN COMPLIANCE WITH -

●  Note - Wherever [Company] is visible, it is understood that the Organization being discussed is __________Enter your Organization Name Here _____________

2  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To ensure that [Company] complies with the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule by establishing procedures for the identification, risk assessment, documentation, and notification of breaches involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), in accordance with federal requirements.

3  DEFINITIONS

Breach: The acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of unsecured PHI in a manner not permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI.

4  UNSECURED PHI: PHI THAT IS NOT RENDERED UNUSABLE, UNREADABLE, OR INDECIPHERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS THROUGH ENCRYPTION OR DESTRUCTION.

Discovery: A breach is considered discovered on the first day it is known, or should reasonably have been known, to the covered entity or business associate (excluding the person committing the breach).

5  BREACH IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT

All workforce members must promptly report any suspected or confirmed breach of PHI to the Privacy Officer.

The Privacy Officer will conduct a risk assessment to determine if an incident constitutes a breach, considering at least the following factors:

The nature and extent of PHI involved, including types of identifiers and the likelihood of re-identification.

The unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made.

Whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed.

The extent to which the risk has been mitigated.

Documentation of all risk assessments, investigations, and determinations must be retained for at least six years.

6  BREACH NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES

7  NOTIFICATION TO INDIVIDUALS

Affected individuals must be notified without unreasonable delay and no later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach.

Notification will be provided in plain language and include:

8  A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED, INCLUDING THE DATE OF THE BREACH AND ITS DISCOVERY.

The types of unsecured PHI involved.

Steps individuals should take to protect themselves.

9  A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT [COMPANY] IS DOING TO INVESTIGATE, MITIGATE, AND PREVENT FURTHER BREACHES.

Contact information for further inquiries.

Notification will be sent by first-class mail to the individual’s last known address, or by email if the individual has agreed to electronic notice.

If there is insufficient contact information for fewer than 10 individuals, alternative notice (telephone, email, or other means) will be used. If 10 or more individuals cannot be reached, a substitute notice will be posted on the organization’s website for at least 90 days or provided via major print or broadcast media.

10  NOTIFICATION TO THE SECRETARY OF HHS

For breaches affecting 500 or more individuals, notification must be provided to the Secretary of HHS contemporaneously with individual notice, and no later than 60 days from discovery.

For breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals, notification must be submitted to the Secretary of HHS no later than 60 days after the end of the calendar year in which the breach was discovered.

11  NOTIFICATION TO THE MEDIA

If a breach affects more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, notification must be provided to prominent media outlets serving that area within 60 days of breach discovery.

12  NOTIFICATION BY BUSINESS ASSOCIATES

Business associates must notify the covered entity of any breach of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay and no later than 60 days after discovery.

The notification must include the identification of each affected individual and any other information required for the covered entity to fulfill its notification obligations.

13  EXCEPTIONS

Notification is not required for breaches involving PHI that has been rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through encryption or destruction, provided the encryption key has not been compromised.

Certain inadvertent or unintentional disclosures by authorized personnel within the scope of their authority may not constitute a reportable breach if there is no further use or disclosure.

14  MITIGATION AND PREVENTION

The Compliance Officer will coordinate breach investigations, mitigation of harm, and implementation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence.

All actions taken in response to a breach, including mitigation and prevention steps, must be documented.

15  TRAINING

All workforce members will receive training on this policy, including how to recognize and report suspected breaches.

16  DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD RETENTION

All documentation related to breach investigations, risk assessments, notifications, and mitigation efforts will be retained for a minimum of six years.

17  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually or upon significant changes to facility operations, technology, or applicable regulations.
