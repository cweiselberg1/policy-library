Accounting of Disclosures

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

45 CFR §164.528

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To ensure [Company] provides individuals or their personal representatives with an accounting of certain disclosures of their protected health information (PHI), as required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

2  POLICY STATEMENTS

3  RIGHT TO RECEIVE AN ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES

Individuals have the right to receive, upon written request, an accounting of disclosures of their PHI made by [Company] or its business associates in the six years before the date of the request, or for a shorter timeframe as specified by the individual.

4  DISCLOSURES SUBJECT TO ACCOUNTING

The accounting will include all disclosures of PHI except for the following, which are excluded from this specific requirement:

When disclosures are needed for the sake of providing treatment, receiving payment for doing so, or general health care operations.

Disclosures that are permitted under HIPAA (e.g., Threats to Public safety, or in cases of self-harm).

Disclosures under a valid patient authorization.

Disclosures for facility directories or to persons involved in the individual’s care, or for notification purposes.

5  DISCLOSURES MADE FOR NATIONAL SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE PURPOSES.

Disclosures to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials with custody of the individual.

Disclosures that are part of a limited data set.

6  DISCLOSURES THAT OCCURRED PRIOR TO THE COMPLIANCE DATE OF APRIL 14, 2003.

7  CONTENT OF THE ACCOUNTING

For each disclosure subject to accounting, the following information must be included:

The date of the disclosure.

The name of the entity or person who received the PHI, and, if known, the address of such entity or person.

A brief description of the PHI disclosed.

A brief statement of the purpose of the disclosure that reasonably informs the individual of the basis for the disclosure, or a copy of a written request for disclosure, if applicable.

8  FOR MULTIPLE DISCLOSURES TO THE SAME RECIPIENT FOR A SINGLE PURPOSE, THE ACCOUNTING MAY INCLUDE

The information listed above for an initial disclosure.

The frequency, or number of disclosures made during the accounting period.

The date of the last disclosure during the period.

For research disclosures involving 50 or more records, a summary accounting may be provided, as described in 45 CFR §164.528(b)(3).

9  TIMELINESS

[Company] must provide the accounting within 60 days of receiving the request.

If unable to provide the accounting within 60 days, a one-time extension of up to 30 days is permitted, provided the individual is notified in writing of the delay and the expected completion date.

10  FEES

The first accounting provided to an individual in any 12-month period will be free of charge.

A reasonable, cost-based fee may be charged for subsequent requests within the same 12-month period, provided the individual is informed in advance and given an opportunity to withdraw or modify the request to avoid or reduce the fee.

11  TEMPORARY SUSPENSION

The right to an accounting may be temporarily suspended at the written request of a health oversight agency or law enforcement official if providing the accounting would be reasonably likely to impede their activities. The request must specify the time for which the suspension is required and must be documented.

12  DOCUMENTATION AND RETENTION

[Company] will document and retain records regarding disclosures, as well as the specific details below for at least six years.

The information required for each disclosure subject to accounting.

The written accountings provided to individuals.

The titles of persons or offices responsible for receiving and processing requests for accounting(s).

13  PROCESS FOR REQUESTING AN ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES

The Compliance Officer is responsible for processing requests, preparing the accounting, and ensuring compliance with all requirements.

14  TRAINING

15  COMPLAINTS
