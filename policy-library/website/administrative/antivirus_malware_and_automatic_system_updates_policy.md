Antivirus, Malware, and Automatic System Updates

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In compliance with 45 CFR §164.308(a)(1)(i)(A)-(B)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) by preventing, detecting, and responding to malicious software, and by ensuring timely application of software updates and security patches, as required by the HIPAA Security Rule.

2  POLICY STATEMENTS

3  ANTIVIRUS AND ANTI-MALWARE PROTECTION

[Company] will deploy, maintain, and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all systems and devices that store, process, or transmit ePHI.

Antivirus and anti-malware solutions must:

Provide real-time monitoring and scanning for viruses, ransomware, spyware, worms, trojans, and other malicious code.

4  BE CONFIGURED FOR AUTOMATIC UPDATES OF VIRUS DEFINITIONS AND DETECTION ENGINES.

5  GENERATE ALERTS FOR DETECTED THREATS AND PROVIDE LOGS FOR AUDIT AND REVIEW PURPOSES.

All workforce members are prohibited from disabling or circumventing antivirus/malware protections unless explicitly authorized by IT management for approved troubleshooting or maintenance.

6  AUTOMATIC SYSTEM UPDATES AND PATCH MANAGEMENT

All operating systems, applications, and firmware on devices that access or store ePHI must be kept up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

Automatic updates must be enabled wherever technically feasible. Where automatic updates are not possible, IT staff must manually check for and apply updates on a regular schedule, at least monthly, and within a reasonable time after critical patches are released.

7  ●  PATCH MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES MUST INCLUDE

Inventory and tracking of all relevant systems and software.

Evaluation and testing of patches before deployment to production systems, when feasible.

Prompt deployment of patches to address known vulnerabilities.

Verification that patches have been successfully applied across all relevant systems.

Any exceptions to promptly applying a software patch must be documented, justified based on risk, and approved by the Compliance Officer.

8  RISK ASSESSMENT AND ONGOING EVALUATION

Regular risk assessments (to be performed annually, at a minimum) will be conducted to identify threats and vulnerabilities related to malware and unpatched software.

The effectiveness of antivirus/malware solutions and patch management practices will also be reviewed and tested annually.

9  [COMPANY] MAY WISH TO COMPLETE RISK ASSESSMENTS MORE OFTEN THAN ONCE PER YEAR, AS MATERIAL CHANGES MAY DICTATE.

10  WORKFORCE RESPONSIBILITIES AND TRAINING

12  THE IMPORTANCE OF RUNNING ONLY AUTHORIZED SOFTWARE AND NOT DISABLING SECURITY CONTROLS.

Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

14  INCIDENT RESPONSE

Any detection of malware, virus, or unauthorized software must be reported immediately to the IT department or Compliance Officer.

Infected systems will be isolated and remediated in accordance with the organization’s Security Incident Response Policy.

15  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with HIPAA regulations and organizational practices.
