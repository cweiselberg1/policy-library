Ongoing Security Risk Assessment

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In Compliance with 45 CFR §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To ensure [Company] conducts an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI), as required by the HIPAA Security Rule.

2  POLICY STATEMENTS

3  REQUIREMENT FOR RISK ANALYSIS

[Company] will conduct and document a comprehensive risk analysis to identify and assess potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI it holds.

The risk analysis will address all systems, devices, and environments where ePHI is created, received, maintained, or transmitted, including but not limited to servers, workstations, mobile devices, cloud services, and portable media.

4  RISK ANALYSIS PROCESS

The risk analysis will include, at a minimum:

Identification of ePHI Flows: Mapping how ePHI is created, received, maintained, and transmitted throughout the organization, including less obvious sources and external parties such as vendors or consultants. This is accomplished via the ‘Data Device Audit’ from One Guy Consulting.

Inventory of Information Systems: Listing all hardware, software, and data assets that store or process ePHI.  This is also accomplished via the ‘Data Device Audit’ from One Guy Consulting.

Threat and Vulnerability Assessment: Identifying human, natural, and environmental threats to information systems containing ePHI (e.g., unauthorized access, malware, natural disasters, equipment failure).

5  ASSESSMENT OF SECURITY CONTROLS: REVIEWING EXISTING SAFEGUARDS AND EVALUATING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN PROTECTING EPHI.

6  LIKELIHOOD AND IMPACT ANALYSIS: DETERMINING THE PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF IDENTIFIED RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES.

7  RISK DETERMINATION: ASSIGNING RISK LEVELS BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD AND IMPACT OF EACH THREAT/VULNERABILITY PAIR.

8  DOCUMENTATION: MAINTAINING DETAILED RECORDS OF THE RISK ANALYSIS PROCESS, FINDINGS, AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE.

9  FREQUENCY AND TRIGGERS

The risk analysis will be conducted:

10  UPON INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS POLICY.

At least annually thereafter.

Whenever there are significant changes to the organization’s environment, operations, or technology that may affect ePHI (e.g., new systems, major upgrades, changes in regulations, security incidents).

11  RISK ANALYSIS REVIEW AND UPDATES

The risk analysis will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it reflects current risks and vulnerabilities.

Updates will be made promptly in response to environmental or operational changes, newly recognized threats, or after a security incident.

12  RESPONSIBILITIES

The Compliance Officer is responsible for overseeing the risk analysis process, ensuring its completion, and maintaining documentation.

All workforce members must cooperate with risk analysis activities and provide information as requested.

13  DOCUMENTATION AND RETENTION

All documentation related to risk analysis activities, including reports, supporting evidence, and decisions, will be retained for a minimum of six years from the date of creation or last effective date, whichever is later.

14  TRAINING
