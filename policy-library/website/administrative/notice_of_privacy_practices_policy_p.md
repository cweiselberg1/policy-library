Notice of Privacy Practices

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In compliance with 45 CFR §164.520

1  PURPOSE

To ensure [Company] provides individuals with clear, accessible, and legally compliant notice of its privacy practices regarding protected health information (PHI), including updates required by the February 16, 2026 HIPAA Privacy Rule amendments.

2  POLICY STATEMENTS

[Company] is committed to maintaining a Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP) that reflects the most current federal privacy requirements. As of February 16, 2026, the following regulatory changes must be incorporated into all NPPs:

2.1  Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Records – 42 CFR Part 2 Alignment

Effective February 16, 2026, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has been aligned with 42 CFR Part 2 regulations governing Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment records. Key requirements include:

•  SUD treatment records are now subject to HIPAA's general framework for uses and disclosures, with specific additional protections.

•  Written patient consent is required before disclosing SUD records for purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations, except in limited circumstances (e.g., medical emergencies, court orders, audits).

•  Redisclosure restrictions apply: Any recipient of SUD information must be notified that the information is protected and cannot be further disclosed without patient consent.

•  The NPP must clearly explain how SUD records are handled differently and the additional protections afforded to this information.

•  Patients must be informed of their right to request restrictions on SUD disclosures beyond what is legally required.

2.2  Required NPP Amendments – February 16, 2026 Deadline

All covered entities must revise their Notice of Privacy Practices by February 16, 2026 to include:

•  A description of the integration of 42 CFR Part 2 protections for SUD records.

•  Updated language regarding prohibited uses and disclosures related to reproductive health care (see Section 2.3).

•  A statement explaining that certain information may have additional protections beyond standard HIPAA requirements.

•  Clarification that disclosed information may be redisclosed by recipients and may no longer be protected by HIPAA, except where other laws apply.

•  Updated complaint procedures and contact information for the Privacy Officer.

•  An attestation requirement statement: [Company] may require written attestation from requestors confirming that PHI is not being sought for prohibited purposes.

2.3  Reproductive Health Information Protections

Effective February 16, 2026, the HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI for certain purposes related to reproductive health care:

•  [Company] will NOT use or disclose PHI for the purpose of investigating or imposing liability on any individual who seeks, obtains, provides, or facilitates lawful reproductive health care.

•  This protection applies regardless of whether the reproductive health care was obtained in a state where such care is legal or in a state with different laws.

•  Requests for PHI that may involve reproductive health information may require a signed attestation from the requestor confirming the information is not being sought for prohibited investigative or punitive purposes.

•  The NPP must inform patients of these protections and their right to confidentiality regarding lawful reproductive health services.

•  Exceptions exist only for disclosures required by law that do not conflict with federal reproductive health privacy protections.

2.4  Implementation Requirements

[Company] shall ensure the following actions are completed:

•  All existing NPPs are revised to incorporate the above requirements by February 16, 2026.

•  Revised NPPs are distributed to all current patients and made available to new patients at the first point of service.

•  The revised NPP is posted prominently in all physical locations and on any website maintained by [Company].

•  Staff training is updated to include the new SUD, reproductive health, and attestation requirements.

•  Documentation systems are updated to track attestations received for PHI requests.

•  The Privacy Officer reviews all policies and procedures to ensure alignment with the updated NPP.
