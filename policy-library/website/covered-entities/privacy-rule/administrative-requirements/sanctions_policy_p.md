Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, verbal warnings, written warnings, suspension, termination of employment, or revocation of access to PHI and ePHI.

All policies and procedures required by HIPAA will be documented and maintained in written or electronic form.

Documentation will include records of workforce sanctions, privacy and security incidents, complaints, and mitigation efforts.

All documentation will be retained for at least six years from the date of creation or the date it was last in effect, whichever is later.

8  SECURITY SANCTION POLICY (45 CFR §164.308(A)(1)(II)(C))

The organization will apply appropriate sanctions against workforce members who fail to comply with security policies and procedures related to ePHI.

Sanctions for security violations will be consistent with those for privacy violations and may include disciplinary actions up to and including termination34.

All sanctions applied will be documented, including the name of the individual, nature of the violation, sanction imposed, and date of action.

9  INVESTIGATIONS AND COMPLIANCE REVIEWS (45 CFR PART 160, SUBPART C)

The organization will cooperate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) during compliance reviews and investigations of complaints regarding HIPAA violations.

10  ALL WORKFORCE MEMBERS MUST PROVIDE REQUESTED INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO RECORDS AS REQUIRED BY HHS.

The organization will not intimidate, threaten, coerce, discriminate against, or retaliate against any individual for filing a complaint, participating in an investigation, or opposing any act or practice made unlawful by HIPAA.

11  CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES (45 CFR PART 160, SUBPART D)

The organization acknowledges that HHS may impose civil money penalties for violations of HIPAA requirements, including privacy, security, and breach notification rules.

Penalties are determined based on the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, as well as the organization's history of prior compliance, financial condition, and efforts to correct the violation.

Penalty amounts vary by violation type and culpability, with maximum annual limits per identical violation as specified in the regulation.

12  PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS (45 CFR PART 160, SUBPART E)

The organization and its workforce have the right to a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) if a civil money penalty is proposed by HHS.

The organization will cooperate fully in any hearing process and ensure all relevant documentation and witnesses are made available as required.
