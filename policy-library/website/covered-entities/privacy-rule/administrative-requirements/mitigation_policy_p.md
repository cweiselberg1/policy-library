In compliance with 45 CFR §164.530(f)

1  MITIGATION POLICY

●  Note - Wherever [Company] is visible, it is understood that the Organization being discussed is __________Enter your Organization Name Here _____________

To establish procedures for promptly mitigating, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect known to [Company] resulting from a use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) that violates the organization’s policies or the HIPAA Privacy Rule, whether caused by the workforce or business associates.

2  POLICY STATEMENTS

Duty to Mitigate

When [Company] becomes aware of a use or disclosure of PHI in violation of its policies or HIPAA requirements, it will take reasonable and practicable steps to mitigate any known harmful effects to affected individuals.

Mitigation efforts will be commensurate with the nature and extent of the violation and the potential harm caused.

Examples of Mitigation Actions

Mitigation may include, but is not limited to:

Retrieving, securing, or destroying improperly disclosed PHI.

Notifying affected individuals of the improper use or disclosure and advising on protective steps.

3  MODIFYING ACCESS CONTROLS OR PERMISSIONS TO PREVENT FURTHER UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES.

4  CHANGING PASSWORDS OR ACCESS CREDENTIALS IF COMPROMISED.

5  PROVIDING ADDITIONAL WORKFORCE TRAINING OR RE-TRAINING ON PRIVACY POLICIES.

Implementing or enhancing technical safeguards.

Terminating or modifying business associate agreements if the associate is responsible for the violation.

6  REPORTING THE INCIDENT TO THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES AS REQUIRED.

Limitations and Practicality

Mitigation is required to the extent practicable, recognizing that complete elimination of harm may not always be possible.

The organization will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of mitigation measures based on the specific circumstances.

Knowledge and Reporting

The duty to mitigate applies only when the organization has actual knowledge of the violation or harmful effect.

All workforce members must promptly report any suspected or known improper use or disclosure of PHI to the Privacy Officer or designated official.

7  COORDINATION WITH INCIDENT RESPONSE

Mitigation activities will be coordinated with the organization’s security incident response and breach notification procedures to ensure comprehensive handling of privacy incidents.

8  DOCUMENTATION

All mitigation efforts, including the nature of the violation, steps taken, and outcomes, must be documented and retained in accordance with HIPAA record retention requirements.

9  DOCUMENTATION WILL BE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY TO IDENTIFY TRENDS AND IMPROVE PRIVACY PRACTICES.

10  TRAINING

Workforce members will receive training on their responsibilities to report violations and the organization’s mitigation procedures.

11  TRAINING WILL EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMELY REPORTING AND EFFECTIVE MITIGATION.

12  ENFORCEMENT
