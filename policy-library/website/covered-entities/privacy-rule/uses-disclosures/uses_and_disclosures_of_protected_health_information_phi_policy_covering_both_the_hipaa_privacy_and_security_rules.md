2  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To establish clear rules for when [Company] may use or disclose Protected Health Information (PHI) with or without individual authorization, ensuring compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3  POLICY STATEMENT

[Company] will use or disclose PHI only as allowed by HIPAA. Some uses/disclosures require written permission (“authorization”) from the individual. Others are permitted or required by law and do not require individual authorization.

4  USES AND DISCLOSURES REQUIRING AUTHORIZATION

Written authorization from the individual (or their personal representative) is required before PHI can be used or disclosed for purposes such as:

Marketing activities not otherwise permitted by HIPAA.

Sale of PHI.

Most psychotherapy notes and disclosures.

5  OTHER PURPOSES NOT RELATED TO TREATMENT, PAYMENT, OR HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS.

Authorizations must:

Be in writing and signed with ‘wet ink’.

Clearly describe the PHI to be disclosed, to whom, for what purpose, and how long the authorization lasts.

Inform the individual of their right to revoke authorization at any time.

6  USES AND DISCLOSURES NOT REQUIRING AUTHORIZATION

PHI may be used or disclosed without written authorization in these cases:

Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations (TPO): For providing treatment, collecting payment, and certain administrative tasks.

As required by law: When mandated by federal, state, or local law.

Public health activities: E.g., disease reporting, vital statistics, or public health investigations.

Health oversight agencies: For audits, investigations, inspections, or licensure.

Judicial and administrative proceedings: By court order or as required by law.

7  LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES

Decedents

Organ and tissue donation

To avert a serious threat to health or safety

Workers’ compensation

Limited facility directories and to family/friends:

If the individual is informed and does not object (or in emergencies, based on professional judgment).

All such uses/disclosures without authorization must comply with the “minimum necessary” standard—only sharing the least amount of PHI needed for the purpose.

8  PROCEDURES

Obtain written authorization whenever required. Maintain documentation of all signed authorizations.

Verify the identity and authority of any person requesting PHI where not obvious.

All workforce members must consult the Privacy Officer when in doubt about whether authorization is required.

All uses/disclosures must be logged as required, including for accounting of disclosures.

9  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with HIPAA regulations and organizational practices.
