45 CFR §164.514(a)-(c)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To establish procedures for the de-identification and re-identification of PHI in compliance with 45 CFR §164.514(a)-(c), ensuring that health information is not individually identifiable and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual.

2  DEFINITIONS

●  PHI (Protected Health Information): Individually identifiable health information held or transmitted by [Company].

●  De-identified Information: Health information that does not identify an individual and for which there is no reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify an individual.

●  Re-identification: The process of assigning a code or other means to de-identified information to allow re-linkage to the original identity, under strict controls.

3  POLICY STATEMENT

[Company] will only consider health information de-identified if it meets the standards and implementation specifications outlined in 45 CFR §164.514(a)-(c). De-identified information is not subject to HIPAA Privacy Rule restrictions.

4  PROCEDURES

5  DE-IDENTIFICATION METHODS

Either of the following methods (Expert determination, or safe harbor) are permitted to accomplish the de-identification of PHI:

6  EXPERT DETERMINATION METHOD

●  A person with appropriate knowledge and experience in statistical and scientific principles must determine that the risk is so small that the information could be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, to identify an individual.

●  The expert must document the methods and results of the analysis that justify such determination.

7  SAFE HARBOR METHOD

8  ALL OF THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR RELATIVES, EMPLOYERS, OR HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS MUST BE REMOVED

●  [Company] must not have actual knowledge that the information could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify an individual.

10  RE-IDENTIFICATION OF DE-IDENTIFIED DATA

●  A code or other means of record identification may be assigned to de-identified information to permit re-identification, provided that:

The code is not derived from or related to information about the individual.l

The code is not otherwise capable of being translated to identify the individual.

The code or mechanism for re-identification is not used or disclosed for any other purpose and is not disclosed to any unauthorized person.

11  DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPING

●  All documentation related to the de-identification process, including expert determinations and removal of identifiers, must be maintained for a minimum of six years.
