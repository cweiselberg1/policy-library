In compliance with 45 CFR §164.310(d), 45 CFR §164.310(d)(2), & 45 CFR §164.310(d)(2)(i)-(iv)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To establish and implement policies and procedures that govern the receipt, removal, movement, reuse, and disposal of hardware and electronic media containing electronic protected health information (ePHI), ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI in compliance with HIPAA Security Rule requirements.

2  POLICY STATEMENTS

3  DEVICE AND MEDIA CONTROLS STANDARD

[Company] will implement policies and procedures that govern the receipt and removal of hardware and electronic media containing ePHI into and out of a facility, as well as the movement of these types of items within the facility.

4  IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS

5  DISPOSAL

All hardware and electronic media containing ePHI must be disposed of in a manner that ensures ePHI cannot be reconstructed or retrieved.

Acceptable disposal methods include physical destruction (e.g., shredding, crushing), degaussing, or certified data wiping software.

Disposal actions must be documented, including device identification, method of disposal, date, and responsible individual.

6  MEDIA RE-USE

Before hardware or electronic media is made available for re-use (either internally or externally), all ePHI must be securely removed using approved data deletion or sanitization methods.

Verification of data removal must be documented and retained.

7  MEDIA RE-USE PROCEDURES APPLY TO REDEPLOYMENT, DONATION, OR TRANSFER OF DEVICES.

8  ACCOUNTABILITY

The organization will maintain a record of the movements of hardware and electronic media containing ePHI, and any person responsible for those items.

Records must include device type, unique identifier (e.g., serial number), movement date, origin/destination, and responsible individuals.

The process must be reviewed periodically for effectiveness, especially for portable devices and media.

9  DATA BACKUP AND STORAGE

Prior to the movement of any equipment containing ePHI, a retrievable, exact replica of the ePHI must be created and securely stored, in case of a worst-case scenario involving data loss in the future.

The backup process must be documented, including date, method, location of backup, and the responsible individual.

10  RESPONSIBILITIES

11  ENFORCEMENT

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may trigger HIPAA breach notification and reporting requirements.
