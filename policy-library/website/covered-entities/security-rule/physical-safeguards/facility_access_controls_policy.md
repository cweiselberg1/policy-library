3  STANDARD: FACILITY ACCESS CONTROLS

The organization will implement measures to limit physical access to electronic information systems and related facilities, while ensuring that properly authorized access is permitted.

4  IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS

Contingency Operations (Addressable)

Procedures will be established and implemented as needed to allow facility access in support of restoration of lost data under the disaster recovery plan and emergency mode operations plan in the event of an emergency.

Only authorized personnel involved in contingency operations will be granted access during such events, and their access will be documented.

5  FACILITY SECURITY PLAN (ADDRESSABLE)

A written facility security plan will be maintained to safeguard facilities and equipment from unauthorized physical access, tampering, and theft.

The plan will include:

6  CONTROLLED ENTRY POINTS (E.G., LOCKED DOORS, SECURITY ALARMS, KEY CARDS, OR BIOMETRIC CONTROLS)

Visitor management protocols (e.g., sign-in logs, visitor badges, escorts)

7  REGULAR REVIEW AND UPDATE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES

Procedures will be implemented to control and validate access to facilities based on individual roles and functions, including:

9  VERIFICATION OF IDENTITY AND AUTHORIZATION PRIOR TO GRANTING ACCESS

11  IMMEDIATE REVOCATION OR MODIFICATION OF ACCESS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN ROLE

Visitor control, including sign-in/sign-out logs and, when appropriate, escorts

12  ACCESS POINTS AND AREAS WITH EPHI WILL BE INVENTORIED AND MONITORED AS NECESSARY.

Date and time of repair or modification

Description and location of the work performed

13  REASON FOR REPAIR/MODIFICATION (ESPECIALLY INCLUDING ANY RELATED TO A SECURITY INCIDENT)
