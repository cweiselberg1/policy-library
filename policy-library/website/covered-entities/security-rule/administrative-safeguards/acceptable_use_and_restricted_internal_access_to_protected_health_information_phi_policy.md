Acceptable Use and Restricted Internal Access to Protected Health Information (PHI)

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In Compliance with 45 C.F.R. § 164.308(a)(3)–(4), 45 CFR § 164.312(a), & 45 CFR § 164.514(d)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To ensure that [Company]’s workforce uses information systems and Protected Health Information (PHI) only for appropriate purposes, and that access to PHI is limited strictly to those with a legitimate business need, consistent with HIPAA’s “minimum necessary” and information access management standards.

2  POLICY STATEMENT

Workforce members may access or use [Company]’s information systems and PHI only for approved business, treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. Access to PHI will be restricted to individuals whose job functions require such access, and only to the minimum PHI necessary to perform their duties.

3  ACCEPTABLE USE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PHI

4  [COMPANY]’S COMPUTER SYSTEMS, EMAIL, INTERNET, AND DATA (INCLUDING PHI) ARE FOR AUTHORIZED BUSINESS PURPOSES ONLY.

Workforce members must:

Use PHI strictly for treatment, billing, operations, or other HIPAA-permitted activities.

5  NEVER ACCESS PHI OUT OF CURIOSITY, FOR PERSONAL INTEREST, OR NON-BUSINESS REASONS.

Never share, send, or disclose PHI through unauthorized channels (such as social media, personal email, or unapproved cloud services).

Protect system access (do not share logins or passwords, and log out when leaving a workstation unattended).

6  IMMEDIATELY REPORT SUSPECTED OR KNOWN MISUSE TO THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER.

Prohibited activities include unauthorized:

Downloading

Copying

Altering or

Transmission

Of PHI.

Other prohibited activities include:

Installing unapproved software on your workstation computer.

Engaging in illegal,

Unethical, or

Disruptive

Behavior using company systems.

7  RESTRICTED INTERNAL ACCESS TO PHI (MINIMUM NECESSARY STANDARD)

8  ACCESS TO PHI IS LIMITED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES/CONTRACTORS WHO NEED IT TO DO THEIR ASSIGNED JOB.

Role-based access controls will be used so that each user only has the least amount of PHI/system access required (e.g., front desk, clinical staff, billing).

9  ACCESS RIGHTS WILL BE REVIEWED AND UPDATED PERIODICALLY (UPON JOB/ROLE CHANGES).

Attempts to access PHI outside one’s authorized scope are strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Physical, technical, and administrative controls (like user IDs, password protection, and auditing) will be used to limit and monitor access.

10  PROCEDURES

11  THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER WILL IDENTIFY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH POSITION.

12  THE IT TEAM WILL ASSIGN ACCESS ACCORDINGLY.

Workforce members will receive training on acceptable use and PHI access restrictions on an annual basis.

All uses of PHI are subject to audit and monitoring.

13  VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY WILL RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION, UP TO AND INCLUDING TERMINATION.

14  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with HIPAA regulations and organizational practices.
