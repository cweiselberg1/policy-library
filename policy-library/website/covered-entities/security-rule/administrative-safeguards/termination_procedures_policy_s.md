Termination Procedures

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In compliance with 45 CFR §164.308(a)(3)(ii)(C)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To establish formal, documented policies and procedures for terminating access to PHI and ePHI when a workforce member’s employment, contract, or authorized relationship with [Company] ends, or when access is otherwise no longer appropriate, in order to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive health information.

2  POLICY STATEMENTS

Notification and Initiation

Human Resources (HR) or the responsible supervisor must provide advance notice to the Compliance Officer and IT Department (or applicable individual) when a workforce member’s employment or engagement is ending, or when their role changes such that access to PHI/ePHI is no longer required.

For involuntary terminations, notification must occur immediately upon decision to terminate.

3  ACCESS TERMINATION

The Compliance Officer or IT Department (or applicable individual) will ensure that all physical and electronic access to PHI/ePHI is terminated no later than the last day of employment or engagement, or as soon as possible for involuntary separations. This includes:

Disabling user accounts for all electronic systems and applications containing PHI/ePHI.

4  REVOKING REMOTE ACCESS PRIVILEGES (VPN, REMOTE DESKTOP, ETC.).

5  COLLECTING KEYS, BADGES, ACCESS CARDS, AND OTHER PHYSICAL CREDENTIALS.

Removing the individual from authorized access lists (including facility, records, and restricted areas).

6  CHANGING SECURITY CODES IF NECESSARY.

7  RETURN OF PROPERTY

The departing workforce member must return all organization-owned devices, media, documents, and materials containing PHI/ePHI before their departure.

HR or the supervisor will verify the return of all property during this process.

8  DOCUMENTATION

All steps taken to terminate access and recover property must be documented by HR and/or the Security Officer and retained according to organizational record retention policies.

Documentation must include the date and time access was terminated, systems affected, and confirmation of property return.

9  EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

If immediate termination of access is not feasible due to technical or operational constraints, compensating controls must be implemented and documented to minimize risk until full termination is completed.

10  ANY EXCEPTIONS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND DOCUMENTED.

11  SANCTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE

Failure to follow this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may be grounds for reporting to licensing or regulatory authorities.

12  REVIEW AND UPDATES

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in law, regulation, technology, or organizational practices.

13  RESPONSIBILITIES

Human Resources/Supervisor: Initiate termination process, notify Compliance Officer/IT (Or applicable individual), recover property, document actions.

Compliance Officer/IT Department (Or applicable individual): Terminate access to all systems and facilities, document actions, implement compensating controls if needed.
