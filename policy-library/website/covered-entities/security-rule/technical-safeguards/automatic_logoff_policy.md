2  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

The purpose of this policy is to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to electronic protected health information (ePHI) by automatically terminating electronic sessions after a period of inactivity.

3  POLICY STATEMENTS

All systems and applications that access ePHI must be configured to terminate user sessions after a predetermined period of inactivity, generally no longer than 15 minutes. Shorter periods may be set for systems in public or high-risk environments.

The inactivity timeout should be established by the HIPAA Security Officer, based on risk assessment findings and workflow considerations.

If technical limitations prevent automatic logoff, a password-protected screen lock or equivalent safeguard may be used and must be documented by IT.

Workforce members are prohibited from bypassing or disabling automatic logoff features. Users should also log off manually or lock their screens when leaving workstations unattended.

IT administrators must review automatic logoff configurations regularly to ensure compliance and effectiveness.

4  ALL EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY MUST BE REVIEWED, DOCUMENTED, AND APPROVED BY THE SECURITY OFFICER.

Responsibilities

The HIPAA Compliance Officer oversees implementation, monitors compliance, and reviews this policy annually or as needed.

IT staff configure and maintain automatic logoff features and provide evidence of compliance during audits.

5  ALL WORKFORCE MEMBERS MUST FOLLOW LOGOFF PROCEDURES AND REPORT NON-COMPLIANT SYSTEMS.

6  ENFORCEMENT

Violation of this policy may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination, as well as additional HIPAA sanctions as required.

7  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with HIPAA regulations and organizational practices.
