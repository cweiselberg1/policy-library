Audit Controls, System Alerts, and Authentication Controls

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In Compliance with 45 C.F.R. § 164.312(a)–(d), 45 CFR § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D), & 45 CFR § 164.308 (a)(5)(ii)(C–D)

1  PURPOSE

To ensure [Company] implements appropriate technical safeguards for electronic protected health information (ePHI), including logging, monitoring, system alerts, and authentication, as required by the HIPAA Security Rule.

2  POLICY STATEMENT

[Company] will use audit controls and system alerts to record, review, and respond to information system activity related to ePHI. Authentication controls will be implemented to verify that only authorized individuals access ePHI.

3  AUDIT CONTROLS AND SYSTEM ALERTS

All systems containing or transmitting ePHI must have audit logging enabled to track:

4  USER ACCESS AND ACTIVITY (LOGINS, LOGOUTS, FILE ACCESSES, CHANGES, DELETIONS).

5  SECURITY-RELEVANT EVENTS (FAILED LOGINS, PRIVILEGE ESCALATIONS, DATA EXPORTS).

Logs must be reviewed for suspicious activity regularly (at least quarterly, or more frequently for high-risk systems).

System alerts or notifications will be enabled to automatically flag:

6  UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS ATTEMPTS.

7  CHANGES TO ACCESS PRIVILEGES.

8  SYSTEM FAILURES OR OUTAGES AFFECTING SECURITY.

Logs are retained for six years and are protected from unauthorized modification or deletion.

Any detected security incident triggers a prompt investigation and follow-up by the Compliance Officer.

9  AUTHENTICATION CONTROLS

Unique user identification (user IDs) is required for all systems containing ePHI.

Authentication is enforced via passwords/passphrases meeting strong complexity requirements. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used where feasible.

User credentials must not be shared. Users are responsible for the actions taken under their credentials.

Default/system accounts must be disabled or secured.

Authentication logs (successful and failed login attempts) shall be audited occasionally for abnormal activity.

10  PROCEDURES

11  ACCESS REQUIREMENTS ARE DETERMINED PER JOB ROLE. THE IT/SECURITY TEAM ASSIGNS AND REVIEWS ACCESS.

Audit logs and alerts are reviewed by designated personnel; incidents are escalated to the appropriate authority.

The workforce is trained regarding:

Safe authentication practices.

Importance of unique credentials and not sharing passwords.

12  THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EPHI ACCESS AND REPORTING SUSPECTED IRREGULARITIES.

13  ENFORCEMENT

Employees who fail to comply (e.g., bypassing authentication, ignoring alerts, tampering with logs) will face disciplinary action up to and including termination.

14  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with HIPAA regulations and organizational practices.
