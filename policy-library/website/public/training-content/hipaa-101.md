## What is HIPAA?

### Definition and Purpose

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law enacted in 1996 that protects the privacy and security of health information. HIPAA establishes national standards for protecting patient privacy while allowing appropriate use and disclosure of health information for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.

### Key Legislation

- **Privacy Rule** (2003) - Controls how health information is used and disclosed
- **Security Rule** (2005) - Sets standards for protecting electronic protected health information (ePHI)
- **Breach Notification Rule** (2009) - Requires notification when patient data is compromised
- **HITECH Act** (2009) - Enhanced penalties and extended HIPAA applicability

### Who Must Comply?

**Covered Entities:**
- Healthcare providers (hospitals, physicians, clinics, mental health providers)
- Health plans (health insurance companies, HMOs, employer health plans)
- Healthcare clearinghouses

**Business Associates:**
- IT vendors and software companies
- Billing and collection agencies
- Data analysis companies
- Transcription services
- Medical record storage services
- Any third party handling PHI on your behalf

### Why HIPAA Matters

Patient privacy is a fundamental right. HIPAA ensures:
- Patients know how their information is used
- Patients can access their own medical records
- Healthcare organizations maintain confidentiality
- Data breaches are detected and reported
- Trust is maintained in the healthcare system

## The Privacy Rule

### What is the Privacy Rule?

The Privacy Rule sets the national standards for the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI). It applies to all patient health records in any format—paper, electronic, oral, or other media.

### Core Principles

**Minimum Necessary Standard**
- Disclose only the minimum amount of information needed to accomplish the intended purpose
- Limit access to PHI to employees who need it to perform their job functions
- Example: A billing clerk does not need access to psychiatric history

**Standard Authorization**
- Written patient consent must be obtained before using or disclosing health information for most purposes
- Patients have the right to read, request corrections to, and obtain copies of their records
- Separate consent required for specific uses (research, marketing, psychotherapy notes)

**Permitted Uses and Disclosures**

*Without Patient Authorization:*
- Treatment and patient care
- Payment and billing operations
- Healthcare operations (quality improvement, staff training, credentialing)
- Public health activities (disease reporting, FDA surveillance)
- Law enforcement (with court orders or proper legal process)
- National security and defense
- Judicial and administrative proceedings

*Requires Patient Authorization:*
- Marketing (unless face-to-face or for healthcare operations)
- Research (except certain limited datasets)
- Psychotherapy notes (highly protected)
- Sale of health information

### De-identified Information

Information that has been stripped of 18 specific identifiers can be used and disclosed without restrictions:

1. Name
2. Address (all geographic subdivisions smaller than state)
3. Phone and fax numbers
4. Email addresses
5. Medical record numbers
6. Health insurance numbers
7. Account numbers
8. Certificate and license numbers
9. Vehicle identifiers and license plate numbers
10. Device identifiers and serial numbers
11. Web URLs
12. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
13. Biometric identifiers
14. Full-face photographs and comparable images
15. Dates (except year) related to the individual
16. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code
17. Dates of admission/discharge
18. Zip codes (except for first three digits)

### Business Associate Agreements

If your organization shares PHI with outside vendors or contractors, a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) must be in place that:
- Specifies permitted uses and disclosures of PHI
- Requires the same privacy and security safeguards
- Includes liability terms and breach notification requirements
- Includes provisions for return or destruction of PHI upon request

## The Security Rule

### Overview

The Security Rule establishes national standards to protect electronic protected health information (ePHI) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. It focuses on information systems and how electronic data is handled, transmitted, and stored.

### Three Key Safeguards

#### 1. Administrative Safeguards
Controls and policies for managing security measures.

**Required Measures:**
- Security management process identifying risks and vulnerabilities
- Designated security officer responsible for compliance
- Information access management limiting access to ePHI
- Security awareness training for all employees
- Security incident procedures for reporting and responding to breaches
- Contingency planning for emergency access to ePHI

#### 2. Physical Safeguards
Controls protecting facilities and equipment from unauthorized access.

**Required Measures:**
- Access controls (badges, locks, surveillance)
- Workstation security policies
- Secure disposal of hardware containing ePHI
- Device and media controls (encryption, inventory tracking)
- Facility access controls and monitoring

#### 3. Technical Safeguards
Technology-based security measures for protecting ePHI.

**Required Measures:**
- Access controls (user IDs, passwords, multi-factor authentication)
- Encryption of data in transit and at rest
- Audit controls logging all access to ePHI
- Integrity controls preventing unauthorized modification
- Transmission security protecting data during electronic transmission
- Regular security testing and monitoring

### Encryption Requirements

All ePHI must be protected with:
- **Data at Rest** - Encrypted on servers, laptops, USB drives, and backup systems
- **Data in Transit** - Encrypted when transmitted over networks (HTTPS, VPN, secure file transfer)
- **Encryption Keys** - Securely managed and backed up
- **Two-Factor Authentication** - Required for remote access to systems containing ePHI

### Audit Logs and Monitoring

Organizations must:
- Maintain comprehensive logs of who accessed what information and when
- Review logs regularly for suspicious activity
- Track failed login attempts
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Retain audit logs for at least 6 years

## Breach Notification Rule

### What Constitutes a Breach?

A breach is the **unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure** of PHI that compromises the security or privacy of the information.

### Four-Factor Risk Assessment

Not all unauthorized access is a reportable breach. A breach is only reportable if there is a significant risk of harm:

1. **Nature and Extent** - How much information was involved? What types?
2. **Unauthorized Persons** - Was it someone inside or outside the organization?
3. **Information Actually Acquired or Viewed** - Was the data actually read, or just accessed?
4. **Mitigation Measures** - Has the breached information been recovered or secured?

**Low Risk Scenarios (No Breach Report Required):**
- Password-protected file emailed to wrong internal recipient who immediately deletes it
- Encrypted data lost in transit (encryption key cannot be compromised)
- Data accessed but not viewed by unauthorized person
- Good faith belief no PHI was actually compromised

**High Risk Scenarios (Breach Report Required):**
- Unencrypted laptop containing patient records stolen from employee's car
- Email with PHI sent to wrong external recipient
- Unauthorized employee accessing and viewing patient records
- Ransomware attack exposing patient data
- USB drive with patient information lost in public

### Breach Notification Requirements

**Notify Within 60 Days:**
- Each affected individual (by mail, email, or phone)
- Clearly stating what information was breached
- What the organization is doing to prevent future breaches
- Steps individuals can take to protect themselves

**Media Notification:**
- If breach affects 500+ individuals, notify local media
- Notify state Attorney General
- Notify major newspapers and broadcast stations

**HHS Notification:**
- Notify Department of Health & Human Services
- Provide list of affected individuals and breach details

### Individual Notification Content

Must include:
- Date of breach and date discovered
- Description of what occurred
- Type of information involved
- Steps individuals should take
- What the organization is doing
- Contact information for questions
- Information about credit monitoring or identity theft protection services (if applicable)
