Encryption, De-Encryption, and Transmission Security

P O L I C Y

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In Compliance with 45 C.F.R. § 164.312(a)–(e), 45 CFR § 164.306, & 45 CFR § 164.308(a)(1)

1  PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

To safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) by enforcing effective encryption, decryption, and secure data transmission practices, as required under the HIPAA Security Rule.

2  POLICY STATEMENT

[Company] will implement encryption and decryption processes for ePHI at rest and in transit, and apply technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access during electronic transmission. All ePHI must be protected using appropriate encryption, both when stored and when transmitted over electronic communications networks.

3  ENCRYPTION AND DE-ENCRYPTION CONTROLS

All ePHI stored on company systems—including servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, and portable media—must be encrypted using technologies approved by [Company] and aligned with current industry standards (e.g., NIST FIPS 140-2).

Decryption keys must be properly managed and protected; access to keys is restricted to authorized personnel only.

Workforce members may not attempt to bypass or disable encryption controls.

Encrypted ePHI may only be decrypted by authorized users for permitted uses as defined in HIPAA and company policy.

4  TRANSMISSION SECURITY

ePHI transmitted over open, public, or untrusted networks (e.g., internet, email, wireless) must be encrypted in transit using secure protocols (such as TLS/SSL, SFTP, VPN).

Unencrypted transmission of ePHI is strictly prohibited unless an exception has been formally documented and approved by the Security Officer, with sufficient compensating controls.

Secure channels must be verified before transmitting ePHI; this includes email encryption solutions, secure messaging platforms, and use of secure file transfer technologies.

All remote access to ePHI must utilize encrypted communications and, subject to risk, multi-factor authentication.

5  PROCEDURES

IT/Security is responsible for selecting and configuring approved encryption solutions, maintaining key management processes, and ensuring regular evaluation of encryption standards.

Users should immediately report any suspected loss of a device or evidence of unencrypted transmission of ePHI.

All changes in encryption standards or transmission processes must be documented, tested, and communicated to relevant staff before deployment.

6  REVIEW AND MONITORING

Encryption implementations, key management processes, and transmission security controls will be reviewed at least annually, or when significant changes to technology or regulations occur.

Audit logs for encrypted transmissions and key accesses must be retained and reviewed for unauthorized activity.

7  ENFORCEMENT

Any workforce member found violating this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Breaches may be reportable to regulatory bodies as required by law.

8  REVIEW AND REVISION

This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with HIPAA regulations and organizational practices.
